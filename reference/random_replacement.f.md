# Function factory for random replacement.

It is designed to generate a replacement by a random combination of
alpha-numeric characters, and apply the same replacement if the input is
repeated.

## Usage

``` r
random_replacement.f(replacement_size = 10, replacement_space = LETTERS)
```

## Arguments

- replacement_size:

  The size of the replacement (number of characters in each
  replacement).

- replacement_space:

  The space from which to sample replacements (default is \`LETTERS\`).

## Value

\`function\`

## Examples

``` r
replace_by <- random_replacement.f()
auto_replace(raw_redaction_rules, replacement.f = replace_by)
