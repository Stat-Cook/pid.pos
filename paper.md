# Summary

The `PID.POS` package is designed to aid with the identification of
personal identifiability risks in data sets. By applying existing
natural language processing techniques, the package is able to identify
proper nouns within a data set. The extraction of proper nouns reduced
the complexity of the data, allowing for a quicker review and oversight
of the data. The package also includes a basic tool for the design, and
implementation of a redaction process.

# Statement of need

The world is embedded in a data revolution. Never before have we had the
depth or breadth of data being captured and analysed than we do at
present, and this is only set to increase. In response, international
bodies are taking steps to ensure legal protection of an individual’s
rights to their own data [@GDPR]. One effect of increase legislation
has been a growing awareness of the role and responsibility of data
controllers [@ICODataController] and the risks of big data
[@clarke2016big]. Among these concerns, a risk of ‘personal
identifiability’ i.e. the ability to directly or indirectly identify an
individual from a dataset [@finck2020they], is paramount and, if
breeched, can lead to reputation damage and fines [@ICOWhatIf].

Where data is structured and comprises only a few hundred observations,
a manual inspection can identify variables which contain directly
personally identifiable data (PID) with a reasonable time investment.
However, in the case of modern large data sets which may comprise
millions of observations, a manual inspection may miss PID if it is
embedded within a passage of text, or is a rarity for the given
variable. The `PID.POS` (Personal Identifiability Detection by Part Of
Speech tagging) package is designed to aid with the identification of
PID risks in data sets. In comparison to existing packages which rely on
a curated list of common names and string-matching, `PID.POS` builds on
the existing `udpipe` framework, extracting all examples of proper nouns
and providing a mechanism for the review and redaction of PID risks.

# Comparison to existing R packages

The need to review data sets to identify risks is not new, and there are
a number of packages which have been developed to aid in this process.
The most notable of these are the `PII` package [@pii], which is
designed to identify personally identifiable features via pattern
matching. These approaches can be effective in identifying PID, but have
a risk of missing edge cases e.g. relying on sentence case to identify
names. The approach taken in `PID.POS` conversely takes the approach of
purposefully extracting all proper-nouns, and hence increase the false
positive rate, with the intention of supplying a simplified extract to
aid human interpretation rather than fully automate it.

# In practice

To install the current version of `PID.POS` package, use the following
code:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("Stat-Cook/PID.POS")
```

To assist with understanding the `PID.POS` package, we include a subset
of the ‘friends’ data set from the `friends` package.

``` r
library(pid.pos)
the_one_in_massapequa
```

|     1 |        15 | Monica Geller    | No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, “God, your brother.” Know what they’ll say this year? “God, you”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Well we think it’s absolutely marvelous that you’re having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we’ve told them all that you’re married.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|     3 |        21 | Rachel Green     | No, I know I don’t either, but ya know what, it’s their party, and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t say anything. If it comes up again, we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|     4 |        76 | Monica Geller    | No, no it’s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don’t say it enough, but I love you. When I look around this room, I’m-I’m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can’t because she’s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. . Was. Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she’s dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? Didn’t see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. You people are made of stone! Here’s to mom and dad! Whatever! |

I think she was.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The package has two main functions for identifying PID risks, depending
on the users needs.  
First, the `data_frame_report` function converts a typical R data frame
into a new data frame of:

-   `ID` - the column and row where the sentence first appears
-   `Token` - the specific proper noun token
-   `Sentence` - the sentence containing proper nouns
-   `Repeats` - the number of times the sentence occurs in the data set
-   `Affected Columns` - the columns in the original data frame which
    contain the sentence

``` r
report <- data_frame_report(the_one_in_massapequa)
report
```

The second function is `report_on_folder` which iterates over a folder
of data files, producing a proper noun report for each. It is foreseen
that this function will be the more useful, used just before data
release to evidence no PID risks.

``` r
report_on_folder('path/to/data/')
browse_model_location()
```

NB: the `data_frame_report` and `report_on_folder` functions automate
the download of the pre-trained `udpipe` model. These models are
required to be cached to the users hard-drive and hence firewall issues
may present. The vignette … is included to help with common issues.

While being able to identify PID risks is the core premise of this
package, it would be remiss to not supply some tools to aid in the
removal of PID. Hence, we supply  
basic functionality designed for minimal technical knowledge to assist
in the redaction of PID.

Where a PID report has been ran, the resulting data frame can be passed
to the function `report_to_replacement_rules` which will convert the
report to a csv file with three headings:

-   `If` - the sentence pattern which, if it matches, the replacement is
    applied
-   `From` - the pattern to be replaced
-   `To` - the intended replacement

``` r
replacement_rules <- report_to_replacement_rules(
  report, 
  path='path/to/report.csv'
)
```

The csv file is intended to be edited by the data controller, who hence
does not need to understand R, and can be reimported using the
`load_replacement_rules` function:

``` r
load_replacement_rules('path/to/report.csv')
```

The `load_replacement_rules` function creates a string replacement rule
to capture the desired redactions, with the option for R to ‘parse’ the
function for use as part of a data pipeline:

``` r
replacement.func <- load_replacement_rules('path/to/report.csv', parse=T)

the_one_in_massapequa |>
  mutate(
    across(
      where(is.character),
      replacement.func
    )
  )
```

For a more advanced user, the `load_replacement_rules` function utilizes
the `str_detect` and `str_replace_all` functions from the `stringr`
package, and hence supports regex. Further utilities are available,
notably tools to automatically encode the `To` column (see [Auto
Replacements](https://stat-cook.github.io/pid.pos/articles/AutoReplacement.html)).
